  <h1>Sales Conversation Scripts</h1>
  <p class="subtitle">Ready-to-use conversation frameworks for Hot, Warm, and Cold quiz leads based on their temperature score and profile</p>

  <!-- HOT LEADS -->
  <h2>Hot Lead Framework (Score 80-100)</h2>
  <div class="card">
    <span class="badge badge-hot">Ready to Buy</span>
    <p style="margin-bottom:20px;color:#999">These leads know what they want. They scored high on purchase intent, value uniqueness highly, and are often interested in custom requests. Your job: remove friction and help them choose.</p>

    <div class="script-section">
      <div class="script-label">Opening (DM, Email, or Call)</div>
      <div class="script-text">
        "Hey [Name]! I saw you took our Handbag Personality Quiz and you're a <strong>[Profile Name]</strong>. Love your taste! I noticed you mentioned you're interested in [reference their quiz answer, e.g., 'having a custom design created']. I'd love to help you find (or create) the perfect piece. Any questions I can answer?"
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="script-section">
      <div class="script-label">Discovery Questions</div>
      <div class="discovery-grid">
        <div class="discovery-q">
          <h4>Have you seen anything in the collection that caught your eye?</h4>
          <p>Reveals if they've browsed. If yes, fast-track to that piece. If no, share their curated picks.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="discovery-q">
          <h4>Is this for yourself or a gift for someone special?</h4>
          <p>Determines product path. Gifters may want pouches or gift cards. Self-purchasers go to catalog or custom.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="discovery-q">
          <h4>Are you leaning toward a ready-to-ship piece or something custom?</h4>
          <p>Custom = schedule consultation. Catalog = send direct links to their profile's curated picks.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="discovery-q">
          <h4>Is there a timeline you're working with?</h4>
          <p>Gift deadline? Catalog ships fast. Custom takes 2-4 weeks. Set expectations early.</p>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="script-section">
      <div class="script-label">Close Path</div>
      <div class="script-text">
        "Based on what you've shared, I think [specific product or custom direction] would be perfect for you. Want me to [send a direct link / set up a free 15-minute design consultation / reserve this piece while you decide]? No pressure at all. I just don't want you to miss out since every piece is one-of-a-kind."
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="tip-box">Hot lead tip: Don't oversell. These leads already want to buy. Your role is concierge, not salesperson. Help them navigate, answer questions, and make the process feel easy.</div>
  </div>

  <!-- WARM LEADS -->
  <h2>Warm Lead Framework (Score 50-79)</h2>
  <div class="card">
    <span class="badge badge-warm">Considering</span>
    <p style="margin-bottom:20px;color:#999">These leads are intrigued but need guidance, reassurance, or a reason to commit. They might be overwhelmed by choices, unsure about the custom process, or comparing options. Your job: educate and build confidence.</p>

    <div class="script-section">
      <div class="script-label">Opening</div>
      <div class="script-text">
        "Hey [Name]! Thanks for taking our Handbag Personality Quiz. I love that you're a <strong>[Profile Name]</strong>. I wanted to reach out personally because your answers tell me you've got great taste and you're looking for something really special. Have you had a chance to check out the pieces we recommended for you?"
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="script-section">
      <div class="script-label">Discovery Questions</div>
      <div class="discovery-grid">
        <div class="discovery-q">
          <h4>What originally drew you to the idea of a hand-painted bag?</h4>
          <p>Surfaces their core motivation. Match your response to their answer (art lover? Gift giver? Frustrated with mainstream luxury?).</p>
        </div>
        <div class="discovery-q">
          <h4>Have you ever seen a painted Louis Vuitton in person?</h4>
          <p>If no, share before/after photos or video content. The quality is always better in person/photo than people expect.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="discovery-q">
          <h4>What's holding you back from pulling the trigger?</h4>
          <p>Direct but caring. Common answers: price, design uncertainty, not sure if it's "them." Each has a specific response (see objection handling below).</p>
        </div>
        <div class="discovery-q">
          <h4>Would a free design consultation help you figure out what's right?</h4>
          <p>The consultation is the strongest warm-to-hot conversion tool. No commitment, no pressure, just a creative conversation.</p>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="script-section">
      <div class="script-label">Nurture Path</div>
      <div class="script-text">
        "I totally understand wanting to think about it. Here's what I'd suggest: check out our Instagram (@newvintagehandbags) for behind-the-scenes content that shows exactly how our artists work. And whenever you're ready, you can always book a free 15-minute consultation. No pressure, just a chance to explore your options with someone who can guide you. Sound good?"
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="tip-box">Warm lead tip: The consultation offer is your best tool. Frame it as a creative conversation, not a sales call. "It's 15 minutes, completely free, and you'll get to chat with our Design Manager Joseph about your vision."</div>
  </div>

  <!-- COLD LEADS -->
  <h2>Cold Lead Framework (Score 0-49)</h2>
  <div class="card">
    <span class="badge badge-cold">Exploring</span>
    <p style="margin-bottom:20px;color:#999">These leads are curious but not ready to buy. They may have taken the quiz casually, might not fully understand the product, or need time and education. Your job: provide value, build trust, and stay top of mind.</p>

    <div class="script-section">
      <div class="script-label">Opening</div>
      <div class="script-text">
        "Hey [Name]! Thanks so much for taking our Handbag Personality Quiz. You're a <strong>[Profile Name]</strong>, which means you've got a really distinctive sense of style. I'm not here to sell you anything today. I just wanted to say hi and let you know that if you ever have questions about our hand-painted bags or the process behind them, I'm here. We love chatting with fellow fashion lovers!"
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="script-section">
      <div class="script-label">Value-First Discovery</div>
      <div class="discovery-grid">
        <div class="discovery-q">
          <h4>Had you heard about hand-painted designer bags before taking the quiz?</h4>
          <p>Gauges awareness level. If new to the concept, share the "about" page or artist spotlight content.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="discovery-q">
          <h4>What caught your attention about the quiz?</h4>
          <p>Reveals entry point. Social ad? Friend's recommendation? Instagram? Tells you what content to prioritize.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="discovery-q">
          <h4>Is there anything about the painted bag concept you're curious about?</h4>
          <p>Open-ended. Let them lead. Common: "Is it really legal?" "Does the paint last?" "How much do they cost?"</p>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="script-section">
      <div class="script-label">Education Path</div>
      <div class="script-text">
        "That's a great question! Here's the short version: [answer their question]. If you want to learn more, we post a lot of behind-the-scenes content on Instagram showing exactly how our artists work. And our email series has some really cool deep-dives into the process, myths about painted bags, and customer stories. Definitely check those out when you have a moment!"
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="tip-box">Cold lead tip: Never push for a sale. Your only goal is to keep the relationship warm and position yourself as a helpful resource. The email nurture sequence will do the heavy lifting over time. Plant seeds, don't harvest.</div>

  <!-- OBJECTION HANDLING -->
  <h2>Common Objections</h2>
  <div class="card">
    <table class="objection-table">
      <tr><th>Objection</th><th>Response</th></tr>
      <tr>
        <td style="color:#FFF">"It's expensive."</td>
        <td>"I totally get that. Here's how I think about it: you're getting an authentic Louis Vuitton bag PLUS a one-of-a-kind piece of hand-painted art. It's two forms of value in one. And unlike mass-produced bags, this can never be replicated. That said, we also have hand-painted pouches and accessories that are a beautiful way to experience our artistry at a more accessible level. Want me to show you some options?"</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td style="color:#FFF">"What if the paint chips?"</td>
        <td>"Great question, and I'm glad you asked. Our artists use professional-grade paints and sealants specifically designed for leather and canvas. We've been doing this since 2016, and customers who bought bags years ago still carry them daily. The artwork holds up beautifully. We stand behind our craftsmanship."</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td style="color:#FFF">"What if I don't like the design?"</td>
        <td>"That's the beauty of our process. For custom pieces, you get a full digital mock-up before we paint anything. You can request changes, try different colors, or even pivot the concept entirely. We don't touch a brush until you say 'that's exactly what I want.' And for catalog pieces, what you see is what you get. No surprises."</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td style="color:#FFF">"Is it legal to paint over a Louis Vuitton?"</td>
        <td>"Absolutely. Once a bag is purchased, the first-sale doctrine gives the owner full rights to modify it however they want. We buy authentic, pre-owned bags on the secondary market and transform them into art. It's completely legal and has been upheld in courts."</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td style="color:#FFF">"I'm not sure it's 'me.'"</td>
        <td>"I hear you. What's interesting is that our collection ranges from super bold and colorful to incredibly subtle and elegant. Some of our most popular pieces are actually very understated. Think tone-on-tone designs, delicate florals, or soft pastels. Based on your [Profile Name] personality, I think you'd love some of the more [tailor to their profile]. Want me to send you a few examples?"</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td style="color:#FFF">"I need to think about it."</td>
        <td>"Of course! Take all the time you need. I'll just mention that since every piece is one-of-a-kind, what's available today might not be tomorrow. No rush at all. But if something catches your eye, it's worth keeping in mind. I'm here whenever you're ready to chat."</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td style="color:#FFF">"My partner won't understand."</td>
        <td>"I hear this a lot, actually! Here's what our customers tell us: once the bag arrives and they see it in person, it clicks. The craftsmanship, the artistry, the compliments from everyone. We've had more than a few partners come back to order one for themselves! Also, the fact that it's an authenticated LV plus original art means it holds genuine value."</td>
